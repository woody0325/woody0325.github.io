Hi, I am a Ph.D candidate in Graduate School of AI at Seoul National University, and being advised by [Prof. Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/).

My research interest is Time-series Forecasting using AI, and related topics such as imbalanced classification/regression, uncertainty estimation, anomaly detection, etc.
